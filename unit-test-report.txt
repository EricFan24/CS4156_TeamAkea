WASHINGTON � The Supreme Court ruled Friday that abortion providers in Texas can go ahead with their lawsuit challenging S.B. 8, the nation's most restrictive abortion law. But the court declined to block enforcement of the law while the court battle continues, so the law remains in effect. The ruling was a blow to Texas, which had sought to make the law nearly impossible to challenge in federal court. The state argued that abortion providers could not contest the law in advance but had to wait until they were sued for violating it. Friday's ruling was only a partial victory for abortion providers, however. The court ruled that the federal government cannot pursue a separate lawsuit filed by the Justice Department that challenged the law. It also narrowed the field of possible defendants that can be sued in any lawsuits that go forward. By a 5-4 vote, the court also said lawsuits cannot proceed against court clerks and some other Texas officials, including the attorney general. Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's three liberals � Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan � were the four who said those officials could be sued."}, {'url': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2021/12/10/demaryius-thomas-death-cause-what-we-know-nfl-broncos/6460874001', 'heading': 'What we know about the death of former NFL star Demaryius Thomas', 'author': 'Scooby Axson', 'description': 'Former\xa0Denver Broncos\xa0wide receiver Demaryius Thomas was found dead Thursday at his home in\xa0Roswell, Georgia, according to police.

The crowd at the gate didn�t know it, but the Marines had been told to close it at 6 p.m. That left just 30 minutes for Capt. Geoff Ball, 33, commander of 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines� Ghost Company, to pluck out a few more people with that elusive combination of affiliation and luck that would get them onto a plane out of Afghanistan. Just 30 more minutes for Cpl. Hunter Lopez, 22, to grab another child out of the sewage canal where hundreds jostled. Just 30 minutes for Capt. Andres Rodriguez, 31, to scan the crowd for men who fit the descriptions in dozens of text messages from people in the United States trying to save their interpreters. The plan for the final �retrograde� of the American war in Afghanistan was clear: On Aug. 26, the British troops stationed at the nearby Baron Hotel would fall back. A few hours later, the 82nd Airborne would take up the Marines� forward positions, allowing Ghost Company to fold into the terminal. And, finally, the 82nd Airborne would fall back to the airport, to waiting planes, ending America�s longest war. The Afghans, who had been on their feet for hours, were passing out in the heat from dehydration. They had been coming by bus, car and foot for 10 straight days, assembling near the jersey barriers, or standing knee-deep in the foul-smelling canal near Abbey Gate, a main entryway to the airport. Corporal Lopez saw a little girl getting crushed and plunged into the mass of people to get her. At around 5:45 p.m., Ghost Company�s Maxton �Doc� Soviak, a 22-year-old Navy corpsman, got a call that someone had fainted next to the jersey barrier; he and another medic went to help. As it turned out, the Marines at Abbey Gate didn�t have 30 minutes left; they had 18. A suicide bomber detonated at 5:48 p.m. More than 100,000 Marines served in Afghanistan over the 20-year war; 474 of them died. They fought in Marja in 2010, only to see the Taliban re-establish themselves there weeks later. They stepped on roadside bombs in Helmand Province. They sometimes committed crimes or crossed the line, including urinating on dead combatants and burning Qurans. Some of the 170 Afghans who died after the suicide bomb went off at Kabul airport may have been killed by American troops, including Marines, who in the chaos believed they were returning fire. But the Marines at Abbey Gate were also witnesses to the end of America�s longest war. During the frenzied last days of August, these Marines were left to determine who would be evacuated from Afghanistan, and who would be left behind. Young men and women just out of their teens became visa officers, forced to make Solomonic decisions that would determine the path of life of thousands of men, women and children. �War is young men dying and old men talking,� Franklin D. Roosevelt once said. The final act of the Afghanistan war was certainly that � negotiated by old men in Doha, Qatar, under the direction of two septuagenarian American presidents. But it was the young who faced the fallout in what would become the largest noncombatant evacuation ever conducted by the U.S. military. Of the 13 American service members � 11 of them Marines � killed in the suicide bombing on Aug. 26, five were 20 years old, and seven more were in their early 20s. One was 31. Their platoonmates, young men and women themselves, are still sifting through the emotional repercussions of those extraordinary last 10 days. Capt. Geoff Ball, call sign �Ghost Six,� joined the Marine Corps because, he says, �it didn�t feel right having other guys go out and fight, while I just sit at home and benefit from their sacrifice without doing anything myself.� After growing up in Littleton, Colo., he got a B.A. in international relations from George Washington University, and was commissioned in 2012. He said goodbye to his pregnant wife and deployed to Jordan with Ghost Company in April, his green seabag filled with 40 books, including Victor Hugo�s �Les Mis�rables.� On the night of Aug. 12, Captain Ball, called �Six� by his Marines, was on a training exercise in Jordan when he received a text from his gunnery sergeant. �Look at the news right now,� it said. The Taliban had captured Kandahar and Herat, Afghanistan�s second- and third-largest cities. The U.S. military had withdrawn from Afghanistan, so President Biden ordered 3,000 troops to Kabul to evacuate Americans. Soon that number would be 5,800. Captain Ball returned to base to the news that Ghost Company of the �2/1,� as the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines is known, should be ready to deploy in 96 hours. Ghost Company evolved from 2/1�s Ghost Battalion, which earned its name, according to Marine Corps legend, through a history of rapid helicopter assaults in Vietnam that left frustrated North Vietnamese commanders in their wake. Senior commanders often gave the toughest missions to the Ghosts of 2/1. On Aug. 18, 110 Marines of Ghost Company landed at Hamid Karzai International Airport on a tarmac that had been cleared after a tragic melee two days earlier, when people surged onto an American warplane�s wings and fell from the sky after it took off. The Marines had seen the news reports and half-expected to see refugees running to their plane when it landed. The tarmac in the middle of the night was �intense, but controlled,� Captain Ball recalled in an interview with The New York Times at Camp Pendleton, Calif., where Ghost Company and 2/1 are based. There was rifle fire just outside the airport, and tracers and flares were going up. Troops from other NATO countries, evacuating their own civilians, occupied almost every part of the sprawling airport. When it came time to sleep, service members found space wherever they could, including in one case on a treadmill. This was the first time in Afghanistan for Captain Ball, and he would not see the country beyond the airport.'}]
