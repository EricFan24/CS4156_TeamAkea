## Project description

We propose to build a service called “Smart Bookmarks”. More often than not, we forget to properly designate bookmarks to folders or find it difficult to scavenge through our long list of bookmarks to find the one we’ve been looking for. We believe associating bookmarks with certain defining words can help to search & sort the bookmarks better.

## Language and Plaform

The project is implemented with Windows OS and Python3.

## Features implemented in first iteration

- Parse news articles from USA Today, NY Times, and NBC News.
- Extract keywords from article titles and generate a list of tags for the article.
- Predict category of an article with trained NLP model.
- Store the bookmark url and tags under unique user IDs.
